# discord-file-dumper
## This will run through the 'messages' file discord gives you in your Data Dump and pull out all of the files linked in them.

Discord's Data Dump does not include the actual files you have uploaded to discord, only the CDN links to access the files.

### Instructions:
 - Paste the contents of the 'messages' folder from your Discord Data Dump into the local 'messages' folder.
